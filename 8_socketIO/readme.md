# Assignment 8, SocketIO:
A simple simple game that aspires to be a multiplayer version Google's running T. rex. Still incomplete. It can currently only generate players connecting to the server; each player can only move right. The game mechanics and UI are under developement.

## Getting started

1. Download the files and unzip them
2. Open your command prompt (Windows)/terminal (OS X/Linux) and check if NodeJS is installed, enter the following command:
```
node -v
```
3. If a version number is returned, navigate to the directory with the downloaded files. 
4. Install the necessary packages:
```
> npm install
```
5. Once NodeJS and the packages are installed properly, run the app by calling:
```
> node server.js
```
6. The port number will be displayed on the command prompt, navigate your web broswer to ```localhost:<port>``` to generate your player character - a white rectangle.

7. At this point in the development stage, pressing the right-arrow key will move your character forward. 

8. Game objectives: TBD...
