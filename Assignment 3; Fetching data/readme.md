# Assignment 3, Fetching Data:
The webpage experiments with JSON to fetch text files and display them. Currently, three poems can be displayed. As shown in class, the assignment can use a local Python server to be fully functional. 

## Getting started

* [Download the files and unzip them]
* [Open your command prompt (Windows)/terminal (OS X/Linux) and check if Python is installed, enter the following command:]
'''
python -V
''''
* [If a version number is returned, navigate to the directory where the downloaded files are]
* [Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:]
'''
# If Python version is 3.X
python -m http.server
# If Python version is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
'''
* [The contents of the directory will run on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL '''localhost:8000''' in your web browser.]
