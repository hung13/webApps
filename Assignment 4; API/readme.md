# Assignment 4, Fetching Fetching API Data:
The webpage pulls JSON data from a random cat API and displays the picture. Some pictures do take a while to load but I couldn't find a way to preload images or to lower resolution to help with the process. 

## Getting started

* Download the files and unzip them
* Open your command prompt (Windows)/terminal (OS X/Linux) and check if Python is installed, enter the following command:
```
python -V
```
* If a version number is returned, navigate to the directory where the downloaded files are
* Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:
```
If Python version is 3.X
python -m http.server
If Python version is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
* The contents of the directory will run on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL ```localhost:8000``` in your web browser.
