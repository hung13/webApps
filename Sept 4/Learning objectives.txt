While im interested in webdev, my skills related to the field are weak compared to where I would like to be. During my first year, When i found out the idm department offers 'dynamics web apps,' i wanted to join immediately. It was only now that the class became available again. So i want to learn and develop as much as i can. I cant really put my goals into words bc they're more of an instrospective feeling, i guess. But properly learning javascript would definitely help me make a step towards my aspirations as a web developer.
